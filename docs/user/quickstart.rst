.. module:: imaginary.client


Getting started
---------------

python-imaginary can be divided into three main parts:

:class:`Imaginary <imaginary.Imaginary>`
:class:`Image <imaginary.image.Image>`
:class:`Operation <imaginary.operations.Operation>`

You can now call the `imaginary` object with a file to receive an `Image` instance
